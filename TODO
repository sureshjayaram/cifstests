       '''The quick test we run is to do:

        mkdir a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x; ls -a ?
        Either that, or an immediately following:
        rmdir ?; mkdir a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x; ls -a
        ?
        will trigger the issue.  Normally the first one and always the second 
        one will on all or most directories fail to show them containing '.'
        and 
        '..'.  The issue is wider, we're seeing file corruptions and 'ls'
